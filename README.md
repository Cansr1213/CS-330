# CS-330 Module Eight Journal
How do I approach designing software?
When I design software, I start by figuring out exactly what needs to be done and the best way to get there. For this project, creating a 3D scene meant focusing on both how it looks and how it works. I kept things flexible and modular so I could make adjustments easily as I went along.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project really helped me level up my design skills. I learned a lot about building 3D models, setting up realistic lighting, and creating textures to make the scene feel immersive. It also taught me the importance of documenting my design decisions so that everything stays clear and organized.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I took an iterative approach for this project. I started by sketching out ideas and creating basic prototypes, then kept testing and tweaking things like lighting and textures. This process helped me refine the scene step by step until everything came together.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The design strategies I used—like starting simple, iterating, and focusing on how everything works together—are super useful for any kind of project. Whether I’m building software or collaborating on creative projects, these tactics help ensure a solid final result.

How do I approach developing programs?
When I develop programs, I like to break everything into smaller tasks so it’s easier to tackle. For the 3D scene, that meant working on one thing at a time, like creating models, scripting animations, or optimizing performance. It kept things manageable and on track.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I leaned into object-oriented programming to keep things organized, especially with all the different objects in the scene. I also learned some new debugging and optimization tricks to make sure everything ran smoothly, even with all the details and effects.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was huge for this project. I kept testing and tweaking things, like adjusting textures, fixing animations, and trying out different camera angles. Each round of updates made the scene better and helped me catch things I might’ve missed otherwise.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
Over the course of the project, I’ve gotten better at structuring my code and using more advanced techniques like shaders and performance tuning. I also got into the habit of documenting everything, which has made it way easier to revisit and update my work.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science is such a powerful tool for creating and solving things in all kinds of fields. This project especially showed me how I can use computational graphics to build engaging, interactive experiences, which is definitely something I can see myself using in the future.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
This project gave me a solid intro to 3D modeling, lighting, and rendering. These skills not only boosted my technical knowledge but also opened up new areas I want to explore, like virtual reality and game development, in the future.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
In a professional setting, these skills are super valuable. Whether it’s creating immersive simulations, building games, or designing visuals that explain data clearly, the tools and techniques I learned during this project will definitely come in handy.
